Resulting (perturbed) ACE file is tape70


Explanation:
An ENDF file contains a large amount of data for a particular nucleus. The data are divided into data blocks - "files" (file number = MF), which are then sub-divided into reactions (reaction number = MT). For example, MF = 3 are reaction cross sections and MT = 1 (still under MF = 3) is the total cross section, MT = 2 is the elastic-scattering cross section etc. (See the ENDF-6 manual on https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/csewg/docs/endf-manual.pdf for details). In your case, the ENDF files are for incident neutrons, so all the data are for neutron-induced reactions.

Some file numbers of interest to you are:
MF = 1 - some general stuff, but includes e.g. the number of neutrons emitted per fission
MF = 2 - the resonance parameters
MF = 3 - the reaction cross sections
MF = 4 - the angular distributions of outgoing particles
MF = 5 - the energy distributions of outgoing particles

In addition to these quantities, the ENDF file also contains covariances for the parameters. These are stored in files MF = 31 (covariances for MF=1 data), 32 (covariances for MF=2 data), 33, 34, 35 etc. These we want to sample to propagate uncertainties. SANDY does this by looking at the data in MF=31 (for fission neutrons), MF=33 (for cross sections), MF=34 (for angular distributions), MF=35 (for energy distributions). Note that sampling MF=33 (as SANDY does) does not include the resonance-parameter covariances in MF=32. These we want to include, and therefore need an extra step in the data processing.

Step 1: Run NJOY on input file input1. This produces 
i) a "pointwise ENDF (PENDF) file" called tape30. This contains the cross section as a function of energy (and includes all resonance peaks, the unresolved region, ..., i.e. the fully reconstructed cross sections vs energy). 
ii) an "ERRORR file" called tape45, which contains the covariance data for the reconstructed cross section data (i.e. the covariance for the data in the PENDF file). 
iii) a PostScript file called tape65, which can be viewed in a document (e.g. PDF) viewer. This shows the cross section and correlation matrix for whichever reactions you want. You can select which cross sections to plot under the covr module.

Step 2: Run SANDY to create perturbed ENDF files (i.e. ENDF files which account for covariances in MF=31, 34 and 35, *NOT* covariances in the cross sections). The input is the original ENDF file (so, tape20), and the outputs will be called tape20-1, tape20-2, ...

Step 3: Run SANDY to create perturbed PENDF files (i.e. PENDF files which *do account* for covariances in MF=32 and MF=33, i.e. the covariances in the cross sections which are contained in the ERRORR file tape45). The input is the unperturbed PENDF file (so, tape30), and the outputs will be called tape30-1, tape30-2, ... NOTE: these outputs are *not* ENDF files like the outputs from step 2, but contain the reconstructed and perturbed cross section data.

Step 4: Copy one of the SANDY ENDF outputs (from step 2), tape20-1, to tape95

Step 5: Copy one of the SANDY PENDF outputs (from step 3), tape30-1, to tape96

Step 6: Run NJOY on input file input2. This brings together tape95 (the perturbed ENDF file, which accounts for MF=31, 34 and 35) and tape96 (the perturbed PENDF file, which accounts for MF=32 and 33, i.e. the cross section data), and produces an ACE file called tape70. This should include all perturbations you want, and can be used in e.g. Serpent.

You'll need to run steps 4-6 for all SANDY outputs (i.e. perturbed file 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
